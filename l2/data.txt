oh carol i am but a fool
darling i love you
though you treat me cruel
you hurt me and you make me cry
but if you leave me i will surely die
darling there will never be another
cause i love you so
dont ever leave me
say youll never go
i will always want you for my sweetheart
no matter what you do
oh carol im so in love with you
